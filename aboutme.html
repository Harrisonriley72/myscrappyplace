					Hello scrapbook friends!  I'm Candace, mother of four, wife, Executive Assistant (my day job), lover of scrapbooking, punches, pretty paper, and all things Creative Memories! I live in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, am originally from Oklahoma City, and lived in McAllen, Texas for 14 years. I started scrapbooking as a teenager and got into it again when my first son was born. That was back in the days of the old peel and stick albums that ruined your photos (although I didn't know that at the time). Even all those years ago, I would cut up cards and add stickers and other things to "dress up" my photo album pages. Sometime in the early 90s I was invited to a Creative Memories party at a friend from church's home and I've been hooked on Creative Memories products ever since. My Mom sold Creative Memories for many years so we spent many fun days and late nights cropping, laughing, eating, and getting albums done. I continued to scrapbook throughout the years as our family grew. We added a daughter, moved to another state, added two more sons, and life got really crazy. I did my best to keep up with my photo albums but took a few years break when working full time with four children. All their activities made for lots of great memories and photos, but no real time to scrapbook. Fast forward a few years, a move back to Oklahoma from Texas, a couple of kids completed college, and I found myself right back at my favorite hobby! I had started a baby through high school album for my daughter her senior year of highschool ... and finally finished it after she was out of college. Then my oldest son got married and COVID happened. I was only home from the office for about six weeks but started working on his wedding album with old CM products I had on hand. I discovered Creative Memories was back in business and better than ever!  I kept ordering products online for myself and finally decided I should just sign up as an Advisor to save myself some money. It's been nearly three years since I signed up and I have loved discovering all the new tools and products Creative Memories has to offer. I finally decided to try to take my passion for scrapbooking one step further and make a go of my little side-gig...so here we are. I hope you will take advantage of the resources I've put together on my website and contact me if you need advice on album projects you want to work on. I'd love to help you get those photos off your phone, out of the "cloud," and into a beautiful album that you and your family can enjoy for years to come. If you're local, I'd love for you to join me at my workshops and crops so we can enjoy scrapbooking in a community of scrap happy friends.

				<h1 class="hidden text-center fw-bold">Why "My Scrappy Place"?</h1>
				<p class="hidden">
					My youngest son was a long way from home, off on the East coast at college, so I set up a 6 foot folding table in his bedroom, cleared away some of the clutter and began scrapping to my heart's content.  For so many years with a houseful of kids and a crazy schedule, I'd work from the dining room table and I always hated having to clear my stuff away and drag it all back out again when I wanted to scrapbook. What a time saver to have everything where I need it and to be able to leave my projects out so I could work on them whenever I wanted! 15 minutes before work, 45 minutes before bed, countless hours on an activity-free weekend and I truly found MY SCRAPPY (aka happy) PLACE! Well, I just kept rearranging things in the house and moving bookshelves into his room, dragging more of my scrapping supplies out and organizing them in his room (poor kid).  Each time he'd come home he'd find that I'd taken over a little more real estate in his room.  The next youngest son graduated from college and got married recently, so the baby got bumped to his brother's room this summer and I've now completely taken over MY SCRAPPY PLACE and I couldn't be happier! Whatever your family situation is, I hope you're able to carve out a little space and time to get SCRAP HAPPY and enjoy creating photo albums for you and yours to enjoy for years to come.
